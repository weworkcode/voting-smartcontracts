# voting-smartcontracts
In this repository I showed how you can build a voting system using solidity

There are rules in this voting system
your vote must not revert back to you so no one knows your name, gender, age, and so on.
we're also going to make sure that one address can only have one vote.
we're going to make sure that voters are eligible
all rules will be clear and understood by everyone
votes will be perfectly recorded so no fraud will be made in the system.
